  "content": "Honestly, we get your skepticism. If you’ve been setting prices manually or using a built-in PMS tool, and it’s been working (more or less), why change? You might have missed a few revenue opportunities, but it feels familiar. Why risk it? Turns out there aremanyreal reasons to implement dynamic pricing using the RoomPriceGenie RMS. Back in 2019,we conducted a studywithnine European hotels. The results showed thateach property experienced an average revenue increase of 22%for a 19-room property, making it clear that automated dynamic pricing worked. But the industry, customer booking habits and technology have all come a long way since 2019 so we decided to find out exactly what our Revenue Management System can achieve for your property today. Our newest, largest performance study examined567properties from nine countries:Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. And the results are in… out of 567 properties using RoomPriceGenie, each experienced anaverage revenue increase of 19%. Let’s break it down. ## How We Conducted the Study We didn’t just pull numbers out of thin air. This study followed a strict methodology to ensure reliable, unbiased results: - 567 propertiesacross various markets and property sizes. - Up to 700 daysusing RoomPriceGenie AutoPilot. - Comparing performance to the Same Time Last Year (STLY)to track improvements. - Excluded properties with irregular usage patterns(e.g., switching AutoPilot off and on frequently). We examined core revenue metrics:total revenue, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and occupancy rates. The goal? To see if automated pricing really makes a difference. Spoiler alert: it does. ## The Results: Revenue Up 19% on Average The numbers spoke for themselves: - Average revenue increase of19% - Average ADR increase of 4% - Average occupancy increase of 14% These numbers confirmed that RoomPriceGenie helps increase room rates while driving higher occupancy, significantly increasing overall revenue. But don’t forget about the benefit you gain beyond the revenue:time. “What used to take days to several weeks to do is now possible in a single day.”— Kiki Shahabi,Steiner Residences “Instead of spending 10 hours every month going over the pricing for the upcoming months, we can now complete it in about 15 minutes.”— Lucas Roth,Raincity Property Group “When we switched to RoomPriceGenie, we very quickly saw the many benefits it would offer us. The intuitive system allowed me to make rate changes and implement different rate strategies at multiple properties quickly and easily. The RoomPriceGenie delivers excellent value for money.”— Pete Saunders,Oakman Group ## What Does a 19% Revenue Increase Mean for Your Property? Knowing that our RMS can increase your revenue by 19% is good, but what would 19% look like in terms of real money? Here are a fewhypotheticalexamples: ## Small property with 10 rooms and $500,000 annual revenue - $500,000 x 19% =$95,000 additional revenue per year - That’s$792 more per room every month. Imagine what you can do with that: - Buy 100 sets of high-thread-count linens ($5,000). - Upgrade to premium mattresses ($7,500). (Just imagine all of the positive guest reviews raving about those new ultra-comfy beds!) - Invest in Google ads to attract direct bookings ($4,000). ## Mid-sized property with 50 rooms and $2,000,000 annual revenue - $2,000,000 x 19%= $380,000 additional revenue per year - That’s$633 more per room every month. With that extra money, you could: - Build a new website with direct booking functionality ($30,000). - Hire two extra front desk team members to offer better guest service ($100,000). - Install Smart TVs in all 50 rooms ($25,000). ## Larger property with 100 rooms and $5,000,000 annual revenue - $5,000,000 x 19%= $950,000 additional revenue per year - That’s$792 more per room every month. This extra revenue could pay for: - An extensive social media ad campaign targeting new markets. - A sustainability upgrade with solar panels. - Creating a loyalty program to increase repeat guests and long-term brand loyalty. You could also invest in sales training for your front desk staff, run a social media ads campaign, or save for a rainy season. The choice is yours, and the amazing fact is thatyou have a choice! Your next question will probably be: are these properties like mine? ## Hotel Size Doesn’t Matter in the Performance of our RMS One key insight from the study is thatroom count had no significant impacton revenue, ADR, or occupancy improvements. Whether you manage a cozy B&B in the Alps, a 100-room boutique hotel in Berlin, or a group of hotels in the UK, RoomPriceGenie’s automated revenue management system helps you maximize your revenue without the stress of constant price monitoring. ## Why These Results Matter for Hoteliers and Travel Accommodation Providers Revenue management isn’t just about increasing prices. It’s about finding the sweet spot where occupancy, rates, and guest satisfaction align perfectly. Yet many hoteliers are hesitant to trust automated solutions. Here are the most common concerns we hear—and why they’re unfounded: 1. “Will I lose control of my pricing?” Absolutely not. With RoomPriceGenie, you’re always in the driver’s seat. Autopilot works based on the parametersyouset, and you can adjust strategies anytime or even turn it off (if you prefer). 2. “Won’t fluctuating prices upset my guests?” A study by the ZHAW School of Management and Lawconfirms thatdynamic pricing does not significantly impact guest satisfaction. Travelers are used to dynamic pricing in other industries, like airlines or ride-sharing apps. More importantly, automated dynamic pricing ensures fair, demand-driven rates, helping properties stay competitive without unnecessary discounting or underpricing. 3. “Is RoomPriceGeniereallyworth the investment? Our data says yes: 19% more revenue with less manual work. And the best part is you can try it for free to see the results for yourself.
