  "content": "Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) have transformed hotel distribution, providing smaller properties with global visibility and a steady stream of bookings. But their commissions—ranging from 15% to 30%—can quietly eat away at Net Average Daily Rate (Net ADR), the metric that most directly reflects your hotel’s bottom line. According toRevOptimum, unchecked OTA reliance can cause up to a 20% drop in long-term profitability. Direct bookings, by contrast, offer higher margins and better guest data but require investment in marketing and technology. If you’re trying to optimize your mix, this comprehensive guide is for you. We’ll explain Net ADR in depth, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both OTA and direct channels, and offer actionable pricing and tech strategies. You’ll also find insights fromPhocuswright,Mews,eZee Absolute, and more to help you make evidence-backed decisions. ## Understanding Net ADR—and Why It’s Critical Gross ADR may tell you what you charge, but Net ADR tells you what you keep. It subtracts costs like OTA commissions, loyalty redemptions, and transaction fees. As explained byLittle Hotelier, ignoring Net ADR leads to distorted views of channel performance. For instance, on a $200 booking through a 22% commission OTA, you net just $156. That $44 per booking adds up fast.RevOptimumshows that a 1% shift from OTAs to direct channels can increase Net ADR by 2–3% for independents. ## Why OTAs Still Matter OTAs are undeniably powerful. They offer access to vast marketing ecosystems—something most hotels can’t replicate on their own. In theMews 2023 distribution brief, OTAs were found to be crucial for new market entry and low-demand seasons. However, that same report reveals the hidden costs. Beyond base commission rates (Booking.com starts at 15%, Expedia can reach 30%), hotels face rate-parity restrictions and data limitations that reduce marketing opportunities and Net ADR. ## The Direct Booking Advantage Direct bookings put you back in control.
