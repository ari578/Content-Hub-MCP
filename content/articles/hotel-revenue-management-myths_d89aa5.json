  "content": "At RoomPriceGenie, we speak with hundreds of independent hotel owners and general managers every week. And we hear the same misconceptions again and again. These myths lead to mispricing, lost revenue, and too much time spent managing rates manually. Let’s set the record straight. Here are five of the most common, and most costly, myths about hotel revenue management. ## Myth #1: Maximizing Occupancy Is Always the Top Priority Many hoteliers fixate on occupancy. Sure, a full house feels like a win. But if you’re filling rooms by underpricing them, you’re missing out on potential revenue. The reality: The goal of revenue management is to maximize revenue, not just occupancy. In the right conditions, raising rates can generate more revenue than selling every room. It’s also often more profitable, since you save on turnover costs. A smarter strategy:Focus on RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), which reflects both rate and occupancy to give a fuller picture of performance. 50-room Hotel Example: Which is more profitable? - Selling 50 rooms at €80 = €4,000 revenue (100% occupancy, €80 RevPAR) - Selling 40 rooms at €120 = €4,800 revenue (80% occupancy, €96 RevPAR) By charging the higher rate, you earn more revenueandsave on the cost of servicing 10 extra rooms. How a revenue management solution helps:RoomPriceGenie automatically balances rate and occupancy to maximize revenue. It also adapts to your preferred pricing strategy, whether you’re focused on growing occupancy, rate, or both.

But there’s a smarter way to boost revenue. The reality:Focusing only on high-demand nights can lead to underperformance on shoulder nights. For example, if you always max out rates on Saturdays but have empty rooms on Fridays and Sundays, you’re missing out on potential revenue. A smarter strategy:Use minimum length-of-stay restrictions on peak nights to encourage longer stays and increase total booking value. How a revenue management solution helps:RoomPriceGenie doesn’t just optimize rates. It also recommends availability controls like minimum stays and multi-night discounts to help you earn more revenue across the full booking window. Learn more:Minimum Stay Restrictions: Smarter Booking Control ## Myth #3: Price Just Below the Competition Some hoteliers set their rates just below their top competitor, hoping to “win” more bookings. It might sound clever, but it might be doing more harm than good. The reality:Blindly following competitors can lead to serious mispricing. If they’re overpriced, you lose out on bookings. If they’re underpriced, you lose out on revenue. And if you both keep undercutting, you risk starting a pricing war that hurts everyone. A smarter strategy:Monitor competitors, but prioritize your own data when making pricing decisions. Factor in booking pace, pickup trends, and historical patterns. How a revenue management solution helps:RoomPriceGenie evaluates your property’s demand alongside pricing for up to ten competitors, continuously adjusting your rates based on real-time conditions.

Besides, our guests would never accept it.” Sound familiar? The truth:Even quiet destinations experience micro-demand shifts, from last-minute events and weather changes to group bookings and cancellations. Dynamic pricing adjusts rates to reflect current demand. And it’s so common today that travelers expect it. A smarter strategy:Update your prices regularly based on demand signals, booking trends, and lead times, not just seasonality.
