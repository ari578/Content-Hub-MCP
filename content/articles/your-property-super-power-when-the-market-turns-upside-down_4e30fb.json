  "content": "That’s exactly when a Revenue Management System (RMS) like RoomPriceGenie really proves its value. It’s not just there to help you make the most of the good times. It’s there to protect your revenue when the market takes a turn. Below, we’ll show you how real-time, automated pricing protected (and even lifted!) revenues during three very different stress tests: Europe’sbiggestmusic show and football event, and Slovenia’s worst natural disaster in decades. ## Eurovision Song Contest 2025 In Basel: Big Week, Not Always Big Business The Eurovision Song Contest brought lights, cameras and plenty of excitement to Basel. Hotels across the city geared up for what looked like a golden opportunity. But as the week kicked off, something surprising happened:demand wasn’t quite what many expected, especially early on. Some properties clung to high rates and five-night minimum stays, only to see bookings stall. Others stayed flexible, adjusting availability, shortening restrictions, and letting the market lead the way. The result? RoomPriceGenie’scustomerssaw an average occupancy of86.9%and a strong ADR. On Saturday night of the ESC 2025,occupancy peaked at 94.2%with rates toppingCHF 300. One of our clients reached90%+ occupancy every single night, by trusting the data, not just the headlines. Hotels that adapted outperformed the rest. Let the data guide your strategy. Stay flexible and ready to adjust when reality sings a different tune. ## When demandshifts: UEFA Euro 2024, Germany Hosting the UEFA Euro tournament is a big deal and German hoteliers were ready. Group-stage nights in key cities were selling fast, with76%–81%of rooms booked well in advance. But after that? Things slowed down. But when the tournament moved past the group stage, things changed. For the early knock-out rounds, fewer guests were booking in advance, and occupancy levels in some cities dropped to below 40%, according to forward booking data. This is why staying flexible is so important. You need to be“aware of what’s going on around you and stay agile to make quick pricing changes so you can maximize profit.” RMS automatically adjusts rates based on the data, lifting prices when demand is strong and easing them when it isn’t. ## When demanddisappears: Slovenia floods, August 2023 August is usually one of the busiest months for tourism in Slovenia (and in Europe). But in 2023,heavy floodshit large parts of the country, damaging infrastructure, disrupting travel, and shaking up demand overnight. For many properties, bookings slowed down. But one B&B owner, and RoomPriceGenie customer, in Ljubljana saw a different outcome: While others were still waiting to see what would happen, RoomPriceGenie responded right away, adjusting prices to stay competitive and helping this property stay full, even in the most challenging conditions. When something unexpected hits, speed matters. You don’t always have time to rethink your strategy, but with the right solution in place, you don’t have to. ## The quiet disruptors: Inflation & shifting seasons Inflation makes it harder to stay profitable In 2024, the cost of running a hotel keeps rising, especially wages and energy bills. Butroom prices? They’re not growing as fast anymore.That makes it harder to keep your profit where it needs to be. A revenue management solutionhelps you adjust your prices based on real demand: when things are quieter, it can help cover your costs, and when demand picks up, it makes sure you’re not leaving money on the table. Climate change is reshaping seasonality Hot summers are sending more travellers north, or shifting their holidays to cooler shoulder months. Researchers call it the “coolcation” trend. The EU Commissionhttps://roompricegenie.com/case-studies/ even predicts that some southern regions like Greece or Spain could lose up to 30% of tourism income, while northern destinations gain. RMS takes this into account: temperature forecasts are already part of the pricing model so when demand shifts due to weather, your rates shift too. You can’t control the weather or the economy. But with dynamic pricing that adapts automatically, you can stay one step ahead. ## The market may shift. Your strategy doesn’t have to. Running a hotel means staying on your toes, from major events to unexpected downturns, from rising costs to changing travel patterns. But that doesn’t mean you have to do it all alone. Revenue management system gives you the tools (and the confidence) to respond in real time, whether demand is booming or dropping off. It’s about more than just reaching new heights; it’s also about safeguarding your revenue every single day, no matter what’s happening outside your front door. Because when the world changes fast, your pricing should too. So you can keep doing what you love: welcoming guests, delivering great experiences, and running a business that works foryou.
