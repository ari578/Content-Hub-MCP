  "content": "In the Netherlands, hoteliers are facing a major change. The government has confirmed that from1 January 2026the reduced VAT rate for overnight accommodation (currently 9%)will be raised to the standard rate of 21%. This change will affect every accommodation provider in the Netherlands, from boutique hotels to family-run B&Bs. While the exact impact will differ for each property, it’s clear that operating costs will shift. However, with the right pricing strategy, agile tools and clear communication, you can turn this change into a chance to strengthen your positioning, improve guest perception and protect profitability. ## Why This Vat Increase Is Happening The government outlines several drivers in the 2025 Tax Plan. The biggest one:additional tax revenue, estimated at roughly€1.2 billion per year. A secondary goal is to simplify the tax system by reducing the number of exceptions. Hoteliers have no influence over the change itself. But how you respond to it? That matters. ## The Impact: Realistic, Manageable, And Different For Every Hotel Research fromCELTH/Decisio(in collaboration with NHL Stenden University) and Significant outlines several possible scenarios — from a slight softening in demand to more noticeable shifts, particularly in price-sensitive leisure segments. Guests may look a little more closely at what they’re getting for the price, and in border regions, the comparison with Germany and Belgium (both of which apply far lower VAT rates) naturally becomes more prominent. But the most important insight from the research is this: it’s not the VAT change alone that shapes demand but how clearly a hotel communicates its value. Hotels that present their offering confidently and consistently tend to experience far less price sensitivity. When guests understandwhyyour stay is worth it, a small price difference becomes much easier to accept. ## What YouCanDo As A Hotelier You can’t control the upcoming change. But youcancontrol how you respond. ## 1. Reassess your margins and segments The shift to 21% is the ideal moment to take a fresh look at your numbers. Which guest segments are most price-sensitive? Where is there room to adjust? How does the impact differ between leisure and business guests? A segment-based approach often yields far more than a general rate increase. Understanding yournet revenue and profit per room typehelps you see where you can absorb a portion of the increase, and where maintaining margins is essential. ## 2. Strengthen your value communication When guests clearly understand what’s included and why your stay is special, a higher rate becomes far easier to justify. Your communication must always start from value, not price. Think clear room descriptions, well-defined USPs, visible benefits, and strong visual content. Explicitly state what is included and what makes the stay unique. Hotels that do this well see that price increases are accepted far more easily. ## 3. Make smart use of the 9% rate The VAT increase applies only to accommodation. Separately sold services such as breakfast, bike rental, wellness, or parking remain at the 9% rate. This creates opportunities to make stay packages more attractive or offer add-ons that enhance the overall guest experience. ## 4. Keep your pricing strategy flexible The market is becoming more dynamic and your prices need to be equally adaptable. RoomPriceGenie helps hotels respond quickly and consistently by automatically adjusting rates based on demand, occupancy, and pace. Small fluctuations in demand don’t become big problems when your pricing is already designed to move with the market. ## 5. Talk about the change openly and keep it simple Today’s guests are accustomed to price fluctuations, whether for flights, fuel, or groceries. What matters is clear and consistent communication, especially when comparing this year to last year, particularly with returning guests. They don’t expect a complicated explanation. A short, transparent message is enough: “From January 2026, our rates include the new VAT rate. As always, we remain committed to quality, transparent pricing, and an unforgettable stay.” Honest, clear, and without unnecessary details. ## The Opportunity Behind The Change Since the VAT increase applies to nearly all accommodations in the Netherlands, your real competition is operating under the same conditions. Guests will continue comparing you with similar Dutch properties — meaning yourvalue storybecomes even more important. In border regions where international competition plays a role, clarity around your unique offering helps you stand out, regardless of price differences. Sarah Waterloo, Business Development Manager at RoomPriceGenie and an experienced hotelier herself, sums it up simply: “You can’t control the VAT increase, but youcancontrol how you respond to it. Hotels with sharp insight into their margins and clear value communication handle the impact best. Transparency and a consistent strategy make more difference than the VAT percentage itself.” ## Conclusion A VAT increase can feel like one more challenge on the list, but it’s also a chance to sharpen your strategy. When you understand the impact, communicate simply, and stay flexible in your pricing strategy, you’ll stay profitable without losing momentum. The hoteliers who adapt today will be the ones leading the market tomorrow.
