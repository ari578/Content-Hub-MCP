  "content": "Ten years ago you could type prices into a spreadsheet once a day and stay competitive. Now online travel agents (OTAs) and nearby hotels change rates many timesevery hour. To keep up, you need the same speed—but without extra night‑shift admin. That’s what rate‑shopper automation does. The tool watches the market 24/7, grabs clean price data, and feeds it into your revenue‑management system (RMS). You stop copying numbers and start making decisions. This guide gives you every step—from choosing a tool to proving it works. ## 1. Why You Need an Automated Rate Shopper ## Spreadsheets cannot keep up Manual logs break when prices move fast. Automated tools collect OTA, brand.com and metasearch rates around the clock.HotelTechReportsays hotels that use real‑time data lift RevPAR by4–8 %versus those that still work by hand.Mewsadds that quick data helps stop “panic discounts” that hurt profits. ## The price of stale rates SiteMinderwarns that out‑of‑date prices create “ghost listings.” A guest sees a cheaper room next door and leaves your page. You can lose up to17 %of direct bookings this way. Bottom line:Every hour of delay can send guests to your rivals. ## 2. What to Look For in a Tool ## Core must‑haves Feature Feature Why you need it Why you need it Hourly or faster updates Hourly or faster updates Keeps pace with OTAs that change all the time Keeps pace with OTAs that change all the time Flexible comp sets Flexible comp sets Compare yourself to different groups (boutique, resort, city) Compare yourself to different groups (boutique, resort, city) Dashboards and alerts Dashboards and alerts See problems at a glance See problems at a glance Open APIs Open APIs Push data straight into PMS, RMS and channel manager Push data straight into PMS, RMS and channel manager Lighthousehighlights colour bars called “rate fences” that flag parity problems before OTAs hide your listing. ## Nice extras - AI demand signals(flights, events) give early warning of busy nights. - Rate‑change speed chartsshow how often a rival cuts or raises price. - Room‑type mappingso you compare like‑for‑like (suite vs suite, not suite vs dorm). Tip:During demos ask vendors to show 90 days of their data for your market. It proves they cover all your channels. ## 3. Plan Your Rollout ## Set clear goals - Lift net ADR 5 %in the first 60 days. - Cut price‑checking timefrom two hours per day to ten minutes. Write each goal into a dashboard widget before you sign a contract. That keeps you focused on results, not features. ## Map the tech stack System System Job Job Integration idea Integration idea PMS PMS Holds real bookings Holds real bookings Use webhooks for instant updates Use webhooks for instant updates RMS RMS Forecasts and pushes prices Forecasts and pushes prices Match every room type one‑to‑one Match every room type one‑to‑one Channel manager Channel manager Sends rates to OTAs Sends rates to OTAs Turn on auto‑push rules for parity Turn on auto‑push rules for parity Makcorpsfound that two‑way APIs cut go‑live time by40 %for small properties. ## 4. Implementation Checklist Print this page and tick off each step. - Clean data and comp set—standardise room codes and delete old rates. - Connect systems—insert API keys, check rate limits, run a 48‑hour test. - Set alerts—for example, email if a rival undercuts you by £5 or more. - Train staff—one‑hour session on “See, trust, act.” Give night auditors a quick guide. - Review after one month—compare ADR, pick‑up pace and how often you changed price.
