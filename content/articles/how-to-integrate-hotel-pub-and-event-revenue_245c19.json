  "content": "Here’s how you can effectively integrate these revenue streams to maximize profitability and improve theguest experience. ## Bundle Packages Across Hotel, Pub, and Event Spaces Guests love a good deal—and nothing says value like a thoughtfully curated package. With bundling, you can increase your average spend per guest while offering unique experiences: - Stay & Dine: Offer a room package with perks like a €20 pub credit or a complimentary drink. - Event & Stay packages: Pair overnight stays with event tickets to increase both occupancy and event attendance. - Seasonal promotions: Create themed holiday bundles, such as a Christmas stay including breakfast, mulled wine, and a ticket to your festive pub night. ## Cross-sell and Upsell During the Booking Journey Upsellingisn’t just about adding extras—it’s about enhancing the guest experience. Technology is your secret weapon here. Appellation Hotelsin California show what’s possible byintegrating all their services—rooms, dining, spa, and activities—into a single system. This empowers staff across departments to upsell effortlessly: a barista casually books a guest’s spa appointment during a chat. It’s easy, personal, and profitable. Here’s how you can emulate this success: - During booking:Offer tasting menus, exclusive event access, or room upgrades as add-ons. - Pre-arrival emails:Encourage guests to reserve pub dinners or event tickets before they arrive. - At check-in:Train your front desk staff to suggest VIP upgrades or special experiences. ## Align Pricing Strategies Across All Venues Dynamic pricingdoesn’t just apply to rooms—it’s a strategy that can tie your hotel, pub, and events together: - Adjust room rates based on event demand, ensuring your hotel capitalizes on peak periods. - Use off-peak times to drive traffic to your pub with happy hours or exclusive menus. - Offer tiered pricing for event tickets, such as standard admission or VIP packages with premium perks. ## Use Technology for Integrated Revenue Management Utilize your Property Management System (PMS), Point of Sale (POS), and Revenue Management System (RMS) to track andforecast revenueacross departments. - Integrate sales data from the hotel, pub, and event grounds to get a complete view of performance. - Track which guest segments spend the most in the pub or events and adjust marketing and pricing strategies accordingly. - Use guest data to create personalized offers (e.g., send a drink discount to guests with a two-night stay). ## Optimize Event Scheduling for Room Demand Plan your event calendar to align with occupancy trends. For example, you can: - Host events during off-peak times to drive room bookings (e.g., live music in winter or themed pub nights). - Organize Sunday brunch events or Monday-night specials to extend weekend stays. ## Create Loyalty Programs That Span All Outlets Reward guests for spending across the hotel, pub, and events. Here are a few examples: - Let guests earn points for every euro spent on rooms, food, drinks, and event tickets. - Offer loyalty members early access to event tickets or pub specials. - Provide escalating discounts or perks as guests spend more across your property. ## Collaborate with Local Vendors and Artists Partnering with local breweries, wineries, or performers offers an opportunity to create memorable experiences that draw both locals and hotel guests. For example, you can pair pub offerings with local drink brands and bundle them with room packages or offer discounted room rates for guests attending live music events. A great example isSingleThread, a three-Michelin-starred restaurant and inn that collaborated with Auberge Resorts, Audi, and OpenTableto create a unique dining experience that connects storytelling, film, and gourmet cuisine. This strategy increases revenue across your hotel, pub, and event spaces and provides your guests with a fresh and unique experience. ## Create Cohesion, Maximize Revenue By blending your hotel, pub, and event ground strategies, you create a cohesive guest experience that maximizes revenue across all departments.
