  "content": "Smart revenue management is all about anticipating what’s around the corner. And while no one can predict the future, wecanidentify the major trends that will influence hotel performance in the year ahead. Here are five trends independent hotels should keep on their radar in 2026, along with practical strategies to turn them to your advantage. ## TREND 1. Buckle Up: Demand Gets Bumpy In 2025, many hotels saw a mix of softer demand, uncertainty in the economy, and more price-sensitive guests that made demand forecasting challenging. Will 2026 be smoother? Don’t count on it. With more global trade tension, shaky consumer confidence, and the possibility of inflation picking up again, booking patterns could remain unpredictable. Rate decisions will require even more careful attention. What Hoteliers Can Do The better you anticipate demand, the less likely you are to price too high or sell out too early. - Update your forecast frequently to spot demand shifts early. - Keep pricing flexible, opening or closing discounted rates as needed. - Use minimum-length-of-stay controls on busy nights to help balance occupancy.

Cost Creep Continues, and Real ADR Feels the Squeeze If your ADR grows only slightly in 2026, you may be worse off than in 2025. According to theOECD, global inflation is expected to average 3.2%in 2026, which means operating costs will continue to rise. Real ADR (your rate adjusted for inflation) matters more than ever. If your rates don’t keep pace with rising costs, margins will shrink. Increasing rates may be especially challenging for economy hotels, whose guests are more likely to trim budgets when costs climb. What Hoteliers Can Do In 2026, revenue managers will need to protect profitability by growing rates while keeping distribution costs under control. - Keep a close eye on competitor rates and resist deep discounting. - Track cost of acquisition for each channel and prioritize the most profitable ones. - Encourage direct bookings with lowest-price guarantees and value-adds.

Airbnb Takes a Big Swing at the Hotel Market For years, many hotels ignored Airbnb as a distribution channel, assuming travelers used it only for vacation rentals. That may be changing. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky recently announced plans to aggressively grow the hotel side of the business. He also touted Airbnb’s roughly 15.5% commission as the lowest in the industry. As more hotels list on the platform, travelers will increasingly compare hotels and vacation rentals side by side. What Hoteliers Can Do If you’re not doing so already, 2026 may be the year to include Airbnb in your pricing and distribution strategy. - Monitor Airbnb pricing as part of your competitor analysis. - Keep rates and content consistent across all sales channels. - Evaluate whether listing on Airbnb makes sense for your market, guests, and distribution mix. Learn more:Busting 8 Myths About Vacation Rentals and Hotel Pricing ## TREND 4. Third-Party Sites Get Craftier One ongoing challenge for revenue managers is third-party channels selling rooms below contracted or published rates. As distribution networks expand, rate misuse has become increasingly common. A recent Expedia study found that 98% of hotels lost revenue last year due to such behavior. When third-party sites undercut your rates, it erodes traveler trust, damages brand perception, and makes consistent pricing difficult. What Hotels Can Do Protecting your rates in 2026 will require vigilance. - Audit online listings regularly to confirm rates are displayed correctly. - Work with partners that respect rate agreements and communicate transparently. - Use an RMS and channel manager to help keep pricing aligned across channels. Learn more:Expedia: Inside the Complex Journey of Hotel Rates ## TREND 5. Intelligent Automation Takes the Driver’s Seat Just as demand becomes harder to predict and costs continue to climb, intelligent automation is stepping in to fill the gap. In 2026, more hotels will adopt smart tools to automate tasks and make faster, more accurate decisions. Revenue management is especially well-suited to automation because it’s data heavy and operates behind the scenes. What Hoteliers Can Do Automation gives independent hotels the ability to work smarter, not harder. Use automated revenue management to: - Improve performance. Hotels using an RMS often see RevPAR increases of 15–20%,according to HotelTechReport. - Price more accurately, keeping rates competitive and aligned with market demand. - Save time by automating manual tasks like rate shopping and pricing updates. Learn more:How to Convince Your General Manager to Say Yes to an RMS ## Staying Ahead in 2026 While trends will come and go, the basics of revenue management remain the same: understand your demand, price dynamically, monitor performance, and adjust often. Independent hotels that stay informed and refine their strategies regularly will be well-positioned to succeed in 2026 and beyond.
