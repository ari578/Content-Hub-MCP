  "content": "## Why Profit KPIs Are Evolving For two decadesRevenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)has been the yard‑stick for hotel performance. Yet RevPAR ignores F&B spend, spa revenue, and—most critically—operating costs. In an era where guests book rooms on points but splurge on cocktails, relying on a rooms‑only metric risks steering your strategy blindfolded. Articles fromSTRandInvestopedianow headline RevPAR’s blind spots and promote broader measures likeTRevPARandGOPPAR. This guide unpacks each formula, weighs pros and cons, and shows how boutique hotels and big‑box resorts alike can blend the metrics for smarter decisions. ## The Big Three Formulas—Side-by-Side KPI KPI Formula Formula What It Captures What It Captures Quick Example* Quick Example* RevPAR RevPAR Room Revenue ÷ Available RoomsorADR × Occupancy Room Revenue ÷ Available RoomsorADR × Occupancy Roomsrevenue only Roomsrevenue only $15,000 ÷ 150 rooms =$100STR $15,000 ÷ 150 rooms =$100STR TRevPAR TRevPAR TotalHotel Revenue ÷ Available Rooms TotalHotel Revenue ÷ Available Rooms Rooms+F&B, spa, parking, etc. Rooms+F&B, spa, parking, etc. $24,000 ÷ 150 =$160revhouse.net $24,000 ÷ 150 =$160revhouse.net GOPPAR GOPPAR Gross Operating Profit ÷ Available Rooms Gross Operating Profit ÷ Available Rooms Profitaftervariable & fixed costs Profitaftervariable & fixed costs $10,200 ÷ 150 =$68Revfine.com $10,200 ÷ 150 =$68Revfine.com *Examples use one day of data for a 150-room hotel. ## RevPAR: The Classic Room-Revenue Gauge What it is:RevPAR tells you how efficiently you fill rooms at what average rate. It’s simple, headline‑friendly, and correlates closely with top‑line growth. The formula—total room revenue divided by available rooms or ADR × occupancy—is plastered across most comp‑set reports (Amadeus Hospitality). ## Why hoteliers love it - Comparability– Chain‑wide or market‑wide, RevPAR levels the playing field. - Speed– You can calculate it in 30 seconds from your PMS night audit. - Pricing feedback– A sudden RevPAR dip flags either falling ADR or soft occupancy. ## Limitations - Ignores restaurant, bar, or spa takings—often 20–40 % of revenue in full‑service hotels. - Says nothing about profit; two hotels with identical RevPAR can have vastly different cost structures. ## Optimisation tips - Upsell within the room category– A $20 premium‑room upsell at check‑in often costs $0 to service. - Dynamic length‑of‑stay controls– Fill shoulder nights without discounting weekends. - Rate‑shopper velocity alerts– React before compset price wars erode ADR. ## TRevPAR: Capturing Ancillary Gold What it is:Total Revenue Per Available Room rolls in all on‑property income—rooms, F&B, spa, parking, resort fees—you name it. STR calls RevPAR the “largest component” of TRevPAR but stresses the latter’s bigger picture (STR). ## Why it matters now - Experience economy– Guests book budget rooms but splurge on rooftop cocktails. - Amenity‑rich resorts– A third of revenue can come from non‑rooms outlets. - Cross‑department accountability– Shows how well the whole team collaborates to drive spend. ## Drawbacks - Still ignores costs; a pricey buffet may boost TRevPAR while tanking margins. - Data collection can be messy if outlets run separate POS systems. Unique insight:Many independents boost TRevPAR by packaging margin‑light experiences (e.g., a guided neighbourhood walk) rather than heavy‑cost F&B buffets. ## GOPPAR: The Profit‑First Lens What it is:Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room subtracts departmental and undistributed expenses before dividing by available rooms. RevFine dubs GOPPAR the only KPI that “pays your bills” (Revfine). ## Why finance teams swear by it - Links commercial decisions directly to the bottom line. - Comparable across resorts with wildly different F&B footprints. - Ideal for incentive plans tied to profitability, not just revenue. ## Challenges - Requires accurate departmental cost allocation—trickier for small properties. - Numbers lag until month‑end close, so not as nimble for day‑to‑day pricing tweaks. Quick win:Start with an 80/20 approach—allocate obvious costs (F&B COGS, spa payroll) weekly; refine overhead splits quarterly. ## When Each Metric Misleads - High RevPAR, low GOPPAR:Luxury hotel slashes rates to boost occupancy; added housekeeping overtime wipes margin. - Rising TRevPAR, flat RevPAR:Conference hotel upsells banquets but rooms are under‑priced—profit potential still unrealised. - Healthy GOPPAR, dropping RevPAR:Asset‑light operator cuts services to maintain profit; guest satisfaction falls, risking long‑term demand.
