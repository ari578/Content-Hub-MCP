  "content": "In a recent webinar withRoomPriceGenie, Canary Technologies, andHotel Boost, hospitality experts shared insights on how independent hoteliers can increase revenue with dynamic pricing and upselling tactics. Here’s what you need to know. ## Why Static Pricing is Costing You Revenue Many hotels still rely on fixed pricing models, using the same rates throughout the year or making only seasonal adjustments. This approach is like selling winter coats at full price in summer—itleaves revenue on the tableandfails to capitalize on demand fluctuations. Dynamic pricing solves this problem by continuously adjusting rates based on real-time factors like: - Market demand - Occupancy levels - Local events - Competitor pricing Rodman von Heeren,our Sales & Revenue Manager at RoomPriceGenie, explained: “Many hotels lose revenue by sticking to static pricing. Our customers, on average, see a 22% increase in room revenue just by using dynamic pricing and automation.” ## How Dynamic Pricing Works A strong pricing strategy relies on real-time data.RoomPriceGenie automates pricingby: - Analyzingmarket trends, competitor rates, and local events - Adjusting pricesup to 24 times a day - Ensuring rates reflect demand while maintaining profitability - Saving hoteliers up to10 hours per weekon manual pricing updates Hotels that implement automated revenue management increase revenue andavoid underpricing in high-demand periodsandoverpricing when demand is low—both of which can harm bookings and revenue. ## The Power of Upselling: Beyond Just Room Upgrades Pricing alone isn’t the only revenue booster. Upselling is a goldmine that many hotels underutilize. Bendix UrlbauerfromCanary Technologieshighlighted: “Many hotels limit upselling to check-in conversations or a pre-arrival email with a 30% open rate. But the reality is, guests are more likely to say yes when offers are timely, relevant, and convenient.” ## Maximizing Upsell Opportunities at Every Stage of the Guest Journey Traditional upselling strategies often focus on face-to-face interactions at check-in. Butthere are multiple touchpoints where you can introduce upsell offers, including: - Before arrival: Send a targeted WhatsApp, SMS, or email offering room upgrades or special packages. - At check-in: Use digital check-in to highlight spa bookings, dinner reservations, or premium WiFi. - During the stay: Promote on-demand services like laundry, parking, or breakfast delivery via messaging apps. - At check-out: Offer late check-out, extended stays, or exclusive discounts for future bookings. As Bendix highlighted: “Check-out is one of the most underestimated opportunities. Hotels using automated upselling tools have seen thousands in extra revenue from just a single campaign.” ## Upselling That Guests Actually Want Most hotels focus on breakfast and room upgrades, but creative upselling goes beyond that. For example, international travelersfrequently forget plug adapters—so why not offer them at check-in? It’s a simple upsell that solves a problem while generating consistent extra revenue. Other easy upsell wins include: - Parking reservations - Early check-in / Late check-out - Room upgrades with better views - Breakfast / Dining packages The key? Offer relevant optionsat the moment when guests are most likely to say yes. ## The Role of Guest Communication in Revenue Growth A well-timed guest message can translate into thousands of dollars in additional revenue. One hotel using the Canary Technologies messaging platform saw a$15,000 increase in revenuefrom a single message about Memorial Day weekend. The takeaway? Don’t wait for guests to come to you—proactively communicate offers via SMS, WhatsApp, or the hotel’s in-app notifications. Guests are more likely to engage with messages on channels they already use daily.

And that a 10% improvement in ratings can lead to 9-15% more bookings? This meansmanaging guest feedback is just as important as pricing and upselling. Ali’i Resortsused a simple strategy:1.
