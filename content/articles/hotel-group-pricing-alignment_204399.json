  "content": "For hotels, group pricing can feel like a battlefield. The sales manager wants to land the deal. The revenue manager wants to maximize revenue. And in the middle? The general manager, who just wants everyone to get along. But group pricing doesn’t have to cause friction. With open communication, shared goals, and the right data, sales and revenue teams can work together to win more businessandmaximize revenue. And that keeps everyone happy. Let’s look at six ways to turn that tension into teamwork. ## 1. Understand What Drives Sales Sales teams are under constant pressure to hit their numbers. That means hustling for leads and nurturing client relationships. Great group opportunities don’t come around often, and when they do, they’re usually time sensitive. That RFP might be the result of months of persistence and patience. Sales is eager to give a speedy response that meets the needs of their client. If the revenue manager comes back with a higher rate – or a flat-out no – it can be frustrating. “Don’t they know how hard I worked for this lead?” ## 2. See the Bigger Picture from Revenue’s Side Revenue managers, meanwhile, are focused on getting the most possible revenue from available room inventory. Group bookings can provide a nice base of business, but they must also support the hotel’s broader profitability goals. When a group inquiry comes in, the revenue manager’s job is to ask tough questions: - Will this group displace higher-rated transient bookings? - Are we taking up valuable inventory on peak nights? - How much ancillary revenue will it spend on property? - How will the group impact availability for our loyal guests and corporate accounts? Declining a group or proposing a higher rate isn’t about being difficult. It’s about making the smartest decision for the hotel overall. Learn more:Group or Transient? Solving the Great Dilemma in Hotel Revenue Management ## 3. Let the Data Be the Decider When objectives clash and emotions run high, data is your best friend. Forecasting and pricing tools can provide clear, real-time insights that support group pricing decisions without allowing emotions to cloud judgment, such as: - Showing demand levels for each night of the group’s stay - Modeling the impact of the group on occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR - Suggesting an optimal group rate based on market data and booking pace With the right tools, group pricing becomes less about guesswork and more about data-driven strategy. Not sure if that group booking is worth it? Find out with aHotel Revenue Displacement Analysis. ## 4. Explain the “Why” Behind the Numbers Pricing isn’t personal, it’s strategic. And the more transparent you are about the reasons behind your decisions, the better the collaboration. Here’s how to foster mutual understanding: - Flag key dates.Let sales know which dates are open for groups and which are off-limits. - Share impact, not just rates.Saying “This rate would displace $3,000 in transient revenue” is more effective than “This rate’s too low.” - Know the status of group bookings.Regularly review which groups are prospective, tentative, or definite so everyone knows where the opportunities lie. When sales understands why you’re making the call, they’re less likely to push back. ## 5. Align Around Shared Goals Sales and revenue may have different day-to-day tasks, but the end goal is the same: convert the most profitable business for the hotel. Here’s how to stay aligned: - Incentivize teamwork.Design bonus plans and targets to reward total revenue, not just individual performance. - Listen and empathize.Sales may see long-term client potential. Revenue might see a window of compression others don’t know about. Talk it out. - Clarify decision hierarchy.Whether it’s the GM, revenue manager, or DOSM, make it clear who has final say and support their decision. - Be willing to compromise.Some decisions aren’t black and white. If it serves the hotel’s best interests, find the middle ground. When your process is clear and your goals are aligned, decisions are faster and more effective. ## 6. Remember: You’re On the Same Team Sure, sales and revenue sometimes see the world differently. But that’s what makes them great at their jobs. At the end of the day, you’re both here to help the hotel succeed – and to look good doing it. When you respect each other’s roles, share insights freely, and align around common goals, group pricing becomes a source of synergy, not stress. And that’s how revenue managers can become internal heroes: by guiding smart strategy under a spirit of collaboration. Hotels love groups, but do groups love your hotel?
