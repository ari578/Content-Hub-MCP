  "content": "When you run an independent hotel, you’re likely a jack of all trades, wearing different hats each day: receptionist, marketer, maintenance worker, and perhaps even the breakfast chef. Therefore, it’s no surprise that revenue management may often slip to the bottom of your to-do list, or may even be nonexistent. But here’s the thing: it’s one of the fastest ways to grow your profit. That’s why we teamed up with SabeeApp for a live webinar “Hotel Revenue Essentials: Smart Tech and Strategies for Growth”,to make revenue management more approachable, more actionable, and way less overwhelming. Missed the session? No problem. Watch the recording or read this quick (and useful) recap. ## Where Independent Hoteliers Stand Today We kicked off the session with a poll: how are you setting your prices right now? Approach Approach % of attendees % of attendees Gut feeling Gut feeling Spreadsheets Spreadsheets 29% 29% Basic PMS / OTA rules Basic PMS / OTA rules 18% 18% Full RMS automation Full RMS automation 18% 18% Almost a third still depend on spreadsheets. They are effective, until manual updates begin to take away your time for guests. “Spreadsheets are a solid start, but they were never meant to replace strategy.”—Natalie Reiter, Director of Revenue Management Services at RoomPriceGenie ## Lightning Round: What Every Hotelier Needs to Know With years of hands-on experience at world-renowned hotels such as The Ritz London and Shangri-La, Natalie is the ideal Genie to consult for practical revenue advice. We hit her with five rapid-fire questions. Here’s the expert insight you can apply today: Big Question Natalie’s Take What You Should Do Occupancy or ADR? Balance both. Track RevPAR to get the full performance view. Automation vs Intuition? Let tech track trends; trust your gut for edge cases. Focus human time on strategy, not spreadsheets. How often to update rates? Hourly in busy cities; daily everywhere else. Use auto-updates in your RMS so you never miss a demand spike. OTA dependency? Use them to get new guests in the door, then give guests a reason to book directly next time. Offer perks at your website for direct bookers. Rate parity? Only if it helps profit. Sweeten your direct channel with extras. ## Mythbusting the Industry’s Favorite Excuses - “Small hotels don’t need revenue management.”→ With fewer rooms, every underpriced night hits harder. - “Stay €1 under your competitors.”→ That’s not strategy—it’s surrender. Price foryourdemand, not theirs. - “Dynamic pricing scares loyal guests.”→ Loyalty comes from hospitality, not static prices. What’s more, a study by ZHAW School of Management and Lawconfirms the positive impact for hotels using dynamic pricing. - “An RMS is a luxury.”→ So was a channel manager once. Now, dynamic pricing is essential. ## The No. 1 Fear: Losing Guests to Price Changes - Gentle nudges, not wild swings - Total control over min/max prices and overrides - Loyal guests? Tag them for custom offers or surprises at check-in ## Transparency, AI, and Staying in Control Not all tech is created equal. Before choosing any RMS, ask: - What data is it using, and how often is it refreshed? - Can I understand why prices change? - Can I override it when needed?
