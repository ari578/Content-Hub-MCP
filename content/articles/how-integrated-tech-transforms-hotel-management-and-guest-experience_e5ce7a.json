Be Visible Where It Counts Dan Freeman, Global Strategic Manager at SiteMinder, emphasized the power of visibility: “65% of guests who find you on Booking.com or Expedia will visit your website. That’s your chance to convert them directly.” This is the “billboard effect, “where OTAs act as visibility tools, and your website becomes the final conversion stop. With dynamic pricing via RoomPriceGenie and metasearch tools like Google Hotel Ads, you don’t just show up. You show up at the right rate, in the right place, at the right time. ## Pro tip: - Use OTAs as discovery platforms - Encourage direct bookings with price parity and added value - Track where your bookings originate to optimize your mix ## 3.
