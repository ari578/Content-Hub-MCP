  "content": "Managing room categories is one of the most important aspects of hotel revenue management. Learn about the following topics: How to Assign Hotel Room Types How many room types should you have? Travelers like to have several pricing tiers to choose from, but they don’t want to be overwhelmed with options. By featuring at least three categories, hotels can generate more revenue by offering an attractive low price for entry-level rooms and higher prices for premium rooms. How to Name Room Types While it can be fun to come up with creative names, it’s better to be simple and practical so that travelers know exactly what to expect. Include details about the bed configuration, view, quality, size, and standout amenities. For example, a “Garden View Queen Room with Balcony” is more enticing than a “Standard Room.” How to Describe Hotel Rooms Online travel agencies (OTAs) translate listings into dozens of languages, so it’s important to be clear and concise. Why should travelers book this room? Include important features like a sitting area, accessibility, and connecting rooms. Bear in mind that travelers often filter searches on OTAs, so list all your popular room amenities. How to Maximize the Impact of Photos Travelers interact with photos more than any other part of property listings. To maximize the impact, ensure rooms are immaculate – uncluttered, with bright lighting and flattering angles. Even small wrinkles in the bedding can ruin the shot. For premium rooms and suites, show what’s special to justify the extra costs. How to Price Hotel Rooms In addition to charging extra for more space and better views, consider other features like a king bed, patio, or large workspace. Use percentages rather than fixed pricing increments between room categories so that prices change proportionately. Over time, track the sales of each room type and tweak descriptions and pricing as necessary. With an automated revenue management solution, the hotel simply configures minimum and maximum rates and desired pricing increments for each room type, and the solution dynamically prices rooms based on current demand patterns, updating rates several times per day.
