This guide distils the noise into ten field‑tested tactics tailored to properties with5–60 keys. Each section packs a mini‑case, at least one long‑tail keyword (for example,dynamic pricing for B&B), and a quick‑start checklist you can put to work today. ## Strategy 1 – Dynamic Pricing by Demand Pulse Dynamic pricing isn’t reserved for global brands. A recentHospitalityNetopinion piece shows independents usingdemand‑sensing RMS toolsroutinely lift ADR without sacrificing occupancy. ## Quick‑start checklist - Baseline two years of ADR and occupancy in Excel or your RMS. - Set guardrails: stay within ± $10 of compset median unless pickup deviates ± 10 %. - Frequency: update daily in peak season; twice weekly in shoulder or low season. 💡Deep dive:See our primer onbusting myths about vacation‑rental and hotel pricing. ## Strategy 2 – Comp-Set Rate-Velocity Tracking Price gaps matter—rate‑change velocitymatters more.Mews’research highlights that velocity alerts help independents avoid knee‑jerk discounts and protect ADR. ## Checklist - Schedule hourly scrapes (or RMS pulls) on critical need dates. - Trigger an alert when any two rivals move ≥ 3 price points within 24 hours. - Respond with fenced offers (e.g. member‑only extras) rather than public cuts. ## Strategy 3 – Personalized Upselling & Cross-Selling Pre‑arrival upsells—late check‑out, picnic baskets, pet kits—drive incremental margin fast.RevenueYourHoteldocumented a41 % jump in booking‑engine conversionand a 10.6 % F&B revenue lift after layering targeted upsells.

In one mini‑case, a 12‑room Napa B&B replaced blanket three‑night minimums with 1‑night gaps mid‑week, addingseven room‑nights and roughly $3,200in monthly revenue. ## LOS playbook - Model scenarios in your RMS to understand the displacement cost of long minimum stays. - Introducesoftmins (e.g. 2 nights) paired with premiums for single‑night stays. - Review pace weekly in high season; monthly when pick‑up is within ± 10 % of last year. ## Strategy 6 – From RevPAR to GOPPAR & Beyond ADR lifts don’t matter if breakfast costs devour the gain.AltexSofturges small hotels to trackGOPPAR (Gross Operating Profit per Available Room)for a true margin lens.
