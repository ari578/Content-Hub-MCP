With RoomPriceGenie, you can set flexible minimum stays that adapt automatically based on occupancy, seasonality, booking pace, and market trends. Imagine applying a three-night minimum around major holidays to maximize profits, then switching to more relaxed restrictions midweek to capture additional bookings.

That means less manual oversight and more confidence your strategy is working. Even if you’re off the clock. By weavingMinLOSinto your revenue management strategy, you stay agile and competitive.
